--------------------------
Prime is for sending request(prime number) to queue.

Randomizer is for receiving response(prime number)  from the queue.

QueueUtil is having sendToQueue and receiveQueue methods to send/receive messages.

QueueInfoDTO is a transformation object.


Sample Output
-------------
Eg : 3 is not a prime number
     6 is a prime number
